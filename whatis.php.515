<h2>The Destinations of Leavers from Higher Education</h2>

<p>The Destinations of Leavers Survey is an annual census of most of our UK and EU taught graduates. The Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) provide the questions and the population of graduates which we are to survey, this year it included <?php echo $popcount ?> graduates who graduated in the 11/12 academic year. The graduates were surveyed six months after their respective graduations to achieve consistency in the results. This year we received responses from <?php echo $rescount ?> graduates giving us a response rate of <?php echo $resprate ?>%.</p>

<p>A <?php echo $resprate ?>% response rate at University level means that data collected is very statistically significant, not only this but at School level much of the data will also be very significant. Where possible, the number of graduates who are part of a quoted result will always be highlighted. The Survey is important to the University because the responses are used as performance indicators by the newspaper league tables, the Key Information Sets and the Higher Education Funding Councils. The University wide results are published by HESA against all other UK Universities.</p>
