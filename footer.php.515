<p style="clear: both;"><strong style="background-color: yellow;">PLEASE NOTE:</strong> There were significant changes to the survey questions in the year 2011/12. As such, comparisons of 2011/12 data with that of previous years cannot accurately be made.</p>
<p style="clear: both;"><strong style="background-color: yellow;">PLEASE ALSO NOTE:</strong> The third-party-supplied Employer Size data for 2011/12 was significantly flawed, and HESA have advised institutions not to use it. As a result, any GEMS queries which specify an employer size for 2011/12 will return zero results.</p>
